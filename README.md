Hearts.rb
=========

Generates images made of emoji characters ("emoji-art").

Installation
------------

This script requires ImageMagick. For macOS, you can run
`brew install imagemagick`.

Run `bundle` in the project directory to install required gems.

Usage
-----

Basic example:

``` sh
ruby hearts.rb -r80 https://placekitten.com/200/300
```

This will generate an 80-character-wide emoji-art version of a local or
web-accessible image.

``` sh
ruby hearts.rb -r80 -o‚ù§Ô∏èüß°üíõüíöüíôüíúüñ§ /Library/Desktop\ Pictures/High\ Sierra.jpg
```

Generates an emoji-art image using only heart emoji.

### Options

`-r`: Pass an [ImageMagick geometry string](https://imagemagick.org/script/command-line-processing.php#geometry)
to resize the output before generating text. Otherwise it will be one character
per pixel of the original image!

`-c`: Pass a number between 0 and 1 to customize how "color coherent" an emoji
must be to be used. Higher numbers will use emoji that have more color variety.
Default is 0.2.

`-o`: Pass a string of emoji characters. Only characters from this set will be
used. Overrides `-c`.

### Files

`hearts.rb`: Generates emoji-art from the given options.

`generate-db.rb`: Regenerates the `db.txt` file from the Emoji data in the
Gemoji gem.

`db.txt`: A space- and newline-delimited database with the following values:
emoji, average red, average green, average blue, standard deviation red,
standard deviation green, standard deviation blue.

### Display Issues

Like with ASCII art, proper display of the resulting image is heavily dependent
on how the text is rendered on the viewer's platform. In particular:

* The emoji must be rendered as fixed-width characters. Not all platforms do
  this for all font configurations.
* The emoji must be rendered as square. Some platforms will use line heights
  different from character widths.
* The color values are calculated from Apple's emoji images in their proprietary
  font. Other platforms' emoji may have entirely different colors.
* Not every platform supports some of the newer complex emoji created using
  zwjs. On these platforms, the emoji will be displayed "decomposed" (e.g.,
  man + woman + child instead of the single man-woman-child emoji), which will
  mess up the fixed-width alignment.


### Things to Do

* Currently the code in `generate-db.rb` flails about trying to figure out if
  the `U+200D` zwj should be used. Some sort of canonical information about when
  it should or should not be used to combine codepoints would be nice.
* Would be cool to use aliases for the `-o` tag (e.g., `-o flags`).
